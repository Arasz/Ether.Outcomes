What is Outcome.NET?
==============

Outcome.NET is a fluent wrapper for .NET that eliminates plumbing code around failure-prone functions.

Ever write a method that could fail intermittently, like a call to a particularly flakly web service?

Typically, you handle this one of three ways: by throwing/catching exceptions, by tacking boilderplate code onto your result with metadata to indicate success or failure, or by wrapping the result in another object (which at least maintains the single responsibility principal by removing the metadata from the result). 

All of these are plumbing, and it's wasteful. Outcome.NET takes the third approach, providing an expressive, fluent wrapper that just works.
