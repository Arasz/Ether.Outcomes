What is Outcome.NET?
==============
Outcome is the ultimate result wrapper! It's great for those awkward moments when you need to return a value, but you might also need to return a list of validation messages, warnings, or a success bit.

It's a fluent, expressive, easy-to-learn spin on the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/dslCatalog/notification.html">Notification pattern</a>, with a few careful tweaks.
